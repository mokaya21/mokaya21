## Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My journey into data analytics wasn’t a “love at first sight” story—it’s more like falling in love over time. The deeper I immersed myself in learning the skills, the more I appreciated the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of this field.

What truly captivated me is the endless vastness of data. In data analytics, there’s no “I’ve mastered it all” moment. It’s a world where curiosity fuels growth, and staying stagnant means being left behind—a challenge I wholeheartedly embrace.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics, but I’ll admit: while economic theories were interesting, the statistics and numbers stole my heart. I’ve always seen myself as a quantitative thinker, yet I struggled to connect my mathematical knowledge to real-world solutions—until I discovered data analytics.

That discovery was a game changer. Through platforms like Coursera, I built a strong foundation in data analytics, earning my certification and diving headfirst into this fascinating field. Since then, I’ve never looked back.

Here, you’ll find repositories showcasing my work—projects that reflect my love for solving problems through data, my growth as an analyst, and my commitment to learning.

Feel free to explore my work, and let’s connect if you’re as excited about data as I am! 🚀
